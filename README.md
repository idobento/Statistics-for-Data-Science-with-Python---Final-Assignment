The assignemt based on housing dataset that you can find in this link:

As part of the assignemnt, I used statistical test (t-test,ANOVA, Pearson correlation and Regression analysis), descriptive statistics and visualizations.

I used these Python's libraries:
Seaborn,Pandas,matplotlib,scipy and statsmodels.

Feel free to contact for any subject.

Thanks,
Ido
