Hey,

Here is my final assignment in IBM's "Statistics for Data Science with Python" course.
The assignemt is on housing dataset (link: https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ST0151EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/boston_housing.csv).
The assignemtn include using statistical test (t-test,ANOVA, Pearson correlation and Regression analysis), Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations.
I used these Python's libraries:
Seaborn,Pandas,matplotlib,scipy and statsmodels.

Feel free to contact for any reason.
Thanks,
Ido
